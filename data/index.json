      "description": "Sharp released the Searcher Double, a double cassette stereo player that offered features like instant editing, dual playback, continuous playback, and multiple recording in one unit. This product introduced a new way to enjoy cassette tape music for the 1980s. Sharps in general tend to sound a bit brassy. This one is no exception. It has 16cm woofers and 'horn tweeters', and it is powered by a Toshiba TA7246AP amplifier chip. According to the service manual, the output power is 2x7W RMS. There was a label on the tape door saying 32W, but that is PMPO (Peak Momentary Power Output), which is nonsense. Sharp says the tape deck offers a frequency response of 30 to 17,000 Hz when using Metal tape, which is quite good for a boombox."
